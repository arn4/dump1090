# Flight Tracker Web Interface
This is my fork of dump1090. The only thing I've customized is the web interface(I moved all the other files in the folder ```repo_stuff```).

On my reciver I've installed both dump1090-mutability and dump1090-fa. 

This web interface can be found at https://uz.sns.it/~arna/progetti/flight-tracker/
